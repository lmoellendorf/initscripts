# /etc/conf.d/devmon: config file for /etc/init.d/devmon

# This daemon was written with a headless system in mind, therfore pop-up
# dialogs that require an X-server are disabled by default.
# 1: Do not show spacefm/zenity pop-up dialogs
# 0 (or any other value than 1): Show the spacefm/zenity pop-up dialogs
#NO_ZENITY="1"

# The user and group under which devmon is run.
# By default it is expected, that a user for devmon has been created, using
# this command:
# `useradd -c "added by me for devmon" -d "/dev/null" -g plugdev -M -N -r -s /sbin/nologin devmon`
# Here you may change this default:
#DEVMON_USER="devmon"
#DEVMON_GROUP="plugdev"

# The kernel has to poll ejectable drives and report media change (and eject)
# events through udev. Here you may specify the kernel polling interval in
# milliseconds:
#POLLING_INTERVAL="2000"

# The mount options passed to udevil and added to udevil's default options.
# By default fmask and dmask are set to grant users of the plugdev group
# read/write permissions
#MOUNT_OPTIONS="fmask=0002,dmask=0002"

# devmon options. See 'devmon --help' for a list of options. Only AUTOMOUNT and
# UNIVERSAL options can be applied.
# For mount options use the MOUNT_OPTIONS variable.
# Only use if you know what you are doing!
#DEVMON_OPTS=""
